Visual Basic for Applications tools allowing to parse VBA files, interpret them and extract behaviour information for malware analysis purpose.

## Installation

SpuriousEmu is available on PyPI, so you can install it using

```bash
pip install spurious-emu
```

## Usage

SpuriousEmu can work with VBA source files, or directly with Office documents. For the later case, it relies on olevba to extract macros from the files. All of the command use a final positional argument to specify the input file to work with.

If you work with VBA source files, the following convention is used:
 - procedural modules have `.bas` extension
 - class modules have `.cls` extension
 - standalone script files have `.vbs` extension

SpuriousEmu uses different subcommands for its different operating modes.

### Static analysis

Static analysis is performed using the `static` subcommand.

Usually, the first step is to determine the different functions and classes defined, in order to understand the structure of the program. You can for example use it to determine the entry point prior to dynamic analysis. It is the default behaviour when using no flag:

```bash
emu static document.xlsm
```

Additionally, for large files, you can use the `-o` flag to serialize the information compiled during static analysis into a binary file that you will be able to use later with the `report` command for example:

```bash
emu static -o document.spurious-com document.xlsm
```

### Dynamic analysis

You can trigger dynamic analysis with the `dynamic` subcommand.

Once you have found the entry-point you want to use with the `static` subcommand, you can execute a file by specifying it with the `-e` flag. For example, to launch the `Main` function found in `doc.xlsm`, use

```bash
emu dynamic -e Main doc.xlsm
```

This will display a report of the execution of the program. Additionally, if you want to save the files created during execution, you can use the `-o` flag: it specifies a directory to save files to. Each created file is then stored in a file with its md5 sum as file name, and a `{hash}.filename.txt` file contains its original name. You can also save a report of the dynamic analysis using the `-r` flag. For example:

```bash
emu dynamic -o extract_files -r report.spemu-out doc.xlsm
```

### De-obfuscation

SpuriousEmu ~will often~ can fail to interpret VBA program, however it should still be able to help you de-obfuscate macros : that is what the `deobfuscate` command is for.

It works with a document, source file or compiled file and writes to the standard output a de-obfuscated version of macros that have been found. The most basic invocation is

```bash
emu deobfuscate document.docm
```

You can customize de-obfuscation with two options:
 - Flag `-p` allows you to evaluate expressions without side effects. Use `-p 0` to disable it, `-p 1` to only handle literal expressions (e.g. replace `"W" + "Scr" & "ip"` with `"WScript"`) and `-p 2` to also handle pure functions (e.g. replace `Chr(37)` with `"%"`)
 - Flag `-s` renames symbols that seem to be obfuscated with legible names (e.g. `1l11l1l` to `var_1`). If it is not specified, all the modules will be de-obfuscated.

Additionally, you can choose to only output a given symbol with the `-e` flag.

Thus, to de-obfuscate `Document_Open`, using clear variable names and decrypting XOR-encrypted static strings, use

```bash
emu deobfuscate -e Document_Open -p 2 -s document.spemu-com
```

Finally, you can use the *experimental* Markov classifier feature : variable names to be demangled are determined by a classifier which tries to compute how English a word appears. It is enabled by the `-m` flag.

### Report production

You can work with `.spemu-out` and `.spemu-com` file with the `report` command.

The `report` commands can have three mutually exclusive flags: `--json`, `--csv` and `--table`, which change the way reports are displayed.

Similarly to the default `static` output, you can use the `--symbols` flag with a `.spemu-com` file to get the list of functions and classes. For example, to have them in a JSON dump, you can use

```bash
emu report --symbols --json program.spemu-com
```

You can extract the files generated by the execution of a program using the `--extract-files` flag, which behaves like the `-o` flag with the `dynamic` command:

```bash
emu report --extract-files files program.spemu-out
```

A timeline of the events can be produced with the `--timeline` flag. It can be made easier to read with the `--shorten` and `--skip-streaks` commands, as in

```bash
emu report --timeline --table --shorten --skip-streaks 10 program.spemu-out
```

## Dependencies

Python 3.8 is used, and SpuriousEmu mainly relies on [PyParsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing) for VBA grammar parsing, and [oletools](http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools) to extract VBA macros from Office documents. Report tables are generated using [PrettyTable](https://github.com/jazzband/prettytable).

[nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man.html) is used as testing framework, and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) to perform static code analysis. `lxml` and `coverage` are used to produce test reports.

## Development


[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used to run the tests on different Python environments, using in turn [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to generate the testing virtual environments. To set the development environment up, run

```bash
pip install tox poetry
poetry install
```

You can run the test suite against a single Python version using

```bash
poetry run nosetest
```

You can then run the full test suite (i.e. test with all the Python versions, and run various checks afterwards) using

```bash
tox
```

All test files are in `tests`, including:
    - Python test scripts, starting with `test_`
    - VBA scripts used to test the different stages of the tools, with `vbs` extensions, stored in `source`
    - expected test results, stored as JSON dumps in `result`


You can use mypy to perform code static analysis:

```bash
poetry run mypy emu
```

Both commands produce HTML reports stored in `tests/report`.
